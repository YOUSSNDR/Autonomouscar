[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstatistics_collector.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "statistics_collector", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "statistics_collector" with any of the following names:

    statistics_collectorConfig.cmake
    statistics_collector-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "statistics_collector" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "statistics_collector_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "statistics_collector" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
